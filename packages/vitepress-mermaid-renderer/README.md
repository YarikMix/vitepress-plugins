> YarikMix maintenance fork of
> [sametcn99/vitepress-mermaid-renderer](https://github.com/sametcn99/vitepress-mermaid-renderer),
> based on 1.2.3 (MIT). Fixes SPA component disposal, late async mount
> callbacks, and serialized rendering across navigation/theme updates. Mermaid
> 11/12 support is unchanged. This package is now maintained in
> [YarikMix/vitepress-plugins](https://github.com/YarikMix/vitepress-plugins).

Install `@wely6743/vitepress-mermaid-renderer` with its `mermaid` and `vue` peers.
Import `createMermaidRenderer` from `@wely6743/vitepress-mermaid-renderer` in the
VitePress theme; pass `{ static: true }` for SVGs without built-in controls.
The standalone stylesheet is exported as `@wely6743/vitepress-mermaid-renderer/css`.
See [upstream maintenance](https://github.com/YarikMix/vitepress-plugins/blob/main/docs/upstream.md) for the imported commits.

## Render result events (maintenance fork)

External viewers can use `static: true` and listen on an ancestor before
starting the renderer. Each `.mermaid-wrapper` dispatches the bubbling DOM event
`vitepress-mermaid:render-complete` with detail
`{ id: string; success: boolean; error?: unknown }`.

```ts
container.addEventListener('vitepress-mermaid:render-complete', (event) => {
  const { id, success, error } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
  // On success, the SVG is already inside event.target (the diagram wrapper).
  // On failure, display an error; static mode has no built-in error panel.
});
```

Retries and theme changes emit further results for the same diagram. Results
from detached wrappers or a destroyed renderer are not delivered. Interactive
mode also emits these events; its controls remain unchanged.
